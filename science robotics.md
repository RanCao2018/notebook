## 2019 Trends and challenges in robot manipulation
__Object__: Building machines inspired by human hands that have a fantastic ability to manipulate objects of vairious shapes. Achieving robust and flexible collaboration between humans and robots is hence the next major challenge.

__Solution__:
* Prompts robots to learn skills from observing humans  performing complex manipulation. This allows robots to acquire manipulation capabilities in only a few trials. However, generalizing the acquired knowledge to apply to actions that differ from those previously demonstrated remains difficult.  
* Constructs databases of real object manipulation, with the goal to better inform the simulators and generate examples that are as realistic as possible. Yet achieving realistic simluation of friction, materialdeformation, and other physical properties may not be possible anytime soon, and real experimental evaluation will be unavoidable for learning to manipulate highly deformable objects. 

__Requirement__:
